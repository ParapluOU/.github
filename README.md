This is the [community health repository](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file) for the **ParapluOU** GitHub organization.

The `profile/README.md` file contains the organization landing page that is displayed on [github.com/ParapluOU](https://github.com/ParapluOU).

Any community health files added here (e.g. `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `FUNDING.yml`, issue/PR templates) will serve as defaults across all repositories in the organization.
